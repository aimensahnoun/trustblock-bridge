This is a **Bridge** project for both Native and ERC20 Tokens.

## Demo
[![TrustBlock Bridge Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62159014/210653447-9c3d4864-28a7-409f-89d0-7a783c8c7a9b.png)](https://www.loom.com/share/983058bc39d14c2aaa69f51e019871ef)

## Front-end

The front-end is built using **NextJS** and **SCSS** for the main components.   

### RainbowKit

![RainbowKit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62159014/210652459-a0f747dd-e389-4b01-9670-02ce368e176d.png)


[RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com) wallet library was implemented in order to multiple ways for the user to connect to the dApp, no matter which wallet they use.

It also comes connected to [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) hooks by default, which makes it easier to have access to many usefull functionalities straight out of the box.

### Contract information

If you want to use your own deployed smart contrants you should change the addresses in `src/utils/chain-info.js


```
CHAIN_ID: {

name: "CHAIN_NAME",

chainId: CHAIN_ID,

contract: "CONTRACT ADDRESS",

rpcUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOERLI_RPC_URL,

token: "TOKEN SYMBOL",

tokenIcon: "https://cryptologos.cc/logos/ethereum-eth-logo.png?v=024",

}


EXAMPLE:
5: {

name: "Goerli",

chainId: 5,

contract: "0x286b955Afe104e7F6E5f91bA56D0e2b7d948De3c",

rpcUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOERLI_RPC_URL,

## Smart Contracts

The project is made up of a total of three smart contracts: 
- **WrapperToken**: an ERC20 contract that allows for creation and minting of new tokens
- **TokanFactory**: a factory smart contract that manages all of the created `ERC20` tokens as well as hold some functionality.
- **Bridge** : Holds the main functionlity for transfering tokens between netowks by using an implementation of the `Factory contract`.

### WrapperToken

The `WERC20` contract etends `OpenZeppelin ERC20` contracts directly and does not have any extra implementation on top of that.

TokanFactory Factory 

The `Factory` contract is a way create and manage `WrapperToken` tokens, it has methods to `create` , `mint`, `burn` as well as get the `balance` of a user.

These methods were created in order to add an extra layer of validation and a different way to access the tokens.

## Back-End

The Backend-end is responsible for listening to events emitted by smart contracts and handling transactions on the target networks

The back-end is structured into a **NodeJS** script and a **Redis** database, linked together a **docker-compose** script.

The **NodeJS** script has event listeners to all necessary methods, and handles the **wrapping** and **unwrapping**  of tokens between networks. a queue is implemented using [Bull](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bull#documentation) that implements the **Redis** database to reprocess failed transactions again in parallel with the event listeners, in order to ensure that no transactions go missed.
